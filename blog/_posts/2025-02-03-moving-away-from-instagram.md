description: My thoughts about social media, and more precisely, Instagram
---

I've always had a love-meh-hate relationship with social media. I remember when I opened a Facebook account for the first time, in 2008. I was very reluctant at the time, not seeing the point in this new fad. Why should I create an account on a new platform, when I already had a Messenger account, and had all the social activity I could ask for on phpBB forums, or (this will shock you), IRL. But I finally succumbed to peer pressure, and started the long descent into the darkness of "modern" social media.

In the following 15-ish years, I've had *(I almost typed "owned", but the term would have been wrong)* several Facebook and Twitter accounts, that I opened and closed a few times, tried Snapchat for a while but did not enjoy it, and lastly joined Instagram with, again, two separate accounts for specific confidentiality settings.

From 2015 to 2022, I started enjoying less and less Facebook, because of their privacy issues, and Twitter, because of the increasing toxicity on the platform. In 2020, I closed my 2 Facebook accounts. By January 2023, I had closed my 2 Twitter accounts. But I still had my Instagram account *(opened in 2012)*, where I had a nice contact bubble, didn't read too many comments on other posts, and led a relatively quiet online life.

Leaving Facebook was easy. In the last few years of my accounts, my activity decreased dramatically. I shared less and less, until it became obvious that I didn't need an account anymore *(I use the term "need" consciously)*. I recently re-opened an account after the birth of my daughter, because some services (child care, school...) only communicate on this platform. But I'm using this account as "read-only", never posting anything on it.

Leaving Twitter was a mixed feeling. I had many good years on it, met really nice people. But I also got caught in the toxic "discussions" (if you want to call them that), hateful comments... Until I couldn't take it anymore, and was only getting stress from the platform. At that time, a Mastodon instace was opened by a buddy, and some of us joined together.

Today I'm at a new crossroads. In the last few months, it has become obvious that Instagram was on a downward slope. The latest declarations of Mark Zuckerberg have shined a light of what should have been obvious *(and probably was, for a lot of people)*, which is that, in the end, this network is not different from the others. The toxicity is there, always more uninhibited. Journalists, artists, are targeted for their opinions. Right-wing extremism is growing everyday. And the latest decision to basically remove moderation and fact-checking on the Meta networks is probably the nail in the coffin of whatever good remained.

In January of 2025, I created a Pixelfed account. Pixelfed, like Mastodon, is a decentralized social network. This means that you have to select an "instance" where you create your account. It can be linked to a location (I've created my account on [pixelfed.fr](https://pixelfed.fr), which is the main French instance), or a hobby (my Mastodon account is on [masto.bike](https://masto.bike), which is, you guessed it, for cycling enthusiasts). An instance is managed by 1 or more admins, has some moderators who make a wonderful job at keeping the toxicity at bay, and regroups mostly like-minded people. Of course this means that it creates a new social bubble, but do we really want to be exposed to *everybody* and *everything*? I don't. That's why  I've come to the decision to post first on Pixelfed, and maybe later on Instagram. But in the end, I think I will start using Instagram in a "read-only" mode, and at some point just stop using it altogether. This would be a major change, because Pixelfed is still a "niche" network, doesn't have many users or content. It would mean losing a lot of social link.
