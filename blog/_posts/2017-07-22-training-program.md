For the last 3 years, I've been working as a technical team leader for IBM Client Innovation Center.

<!--more-->

Although this experience has brought me a lot (team management, project management...), I've lacked the time to really stay up-to-date with the more recent technologies.

That's why I've decided to compile a list of a few technologies I'd like to learn or improve on during the next few months:

* Kotlin
* Spring 5
* NoSQL
* Docker
* Angular

I'll update this list if needed, and try to write on the different items, with the sources I find and use.
