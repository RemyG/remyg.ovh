ComicsCalendar is a calendar interface for new comic books issues retrieved from ComicVine.

This website allows you to follow some comic books series (or volumes), and see when the next issue will be published.

## Self-hosted

ComicsCalendar is meant to run on your own server. You only need a \*AMP stack (Apache, MySql, PHP).

## Open-source

Comics Calendar is released under an MIT License, which means that you can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this application. The only restriction attached to it is that you have to include the original license in your copy.

All the comic books information is retrieved from, and is a property of ComicVine.

## Multi-user

ComicsCalendar is meant to be used as a multi-user application.
