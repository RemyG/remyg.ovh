RSSReader has been created to be an open-source, self-hosted alternative to traditional RSS aggregators and readers like Google Reader, Netvibes or Feedly.

## Self-hosted

RSSReader is meant to run on your own server. You only need a \*AMP stack (Apache, MySql, PHP). This means that, unlike with RSS aggregators like Google Reader, Feedly or Netvibes, you own your data. Your personal information won't ever be given or sold.

## Open-source

RSSReader is released under an MIT License, which means that you can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this application. The only restriction attached to it is that you have to include the original license in your copy.
