I've decided to create my own Wordpress theme, RGResponsive. 

You can find the sources for this theme [on GitHub](https://github.com/RemyG/wordpress-rgresponsive), and see it in action [on my blog](http://blog.remyg.fr).

You can follow the development and post comments [on this page]({{ root_url }}/projects/rgresponsive/).
